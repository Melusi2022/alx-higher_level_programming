0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

There comes situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code. Decision-making statements in programming languages decide the direction(Control Flow) of the flow of program execution. 

The if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not.

Syntax: 

if condition:
   # Statements to execute if
   # condition is true
Here, the condition after evaluation will be either true or false. if the statement accepts boolean values â€“ if the value is true then it will execute the block of statements below it otherwise not.

As we know, python uses indentation to identify a block. So the block under an if statement will be identified as shown in the below example:  

if condition:
   statement1
statement2

# Here if the condition is true, if block 
# will consider only statement1 to be inside 
# its block.
