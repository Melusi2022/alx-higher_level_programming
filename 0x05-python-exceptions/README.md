0x05. Python - Exceptions

Different types of exceptions in python:
In Python, there are several built-in exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. Here are some of the most common types of exceptions in Python:

SyntaxError: This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.
TypeError: This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.
NameError: This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.
IndexError: This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.
KeyError: This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
ValueError: This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.
AttributeError: This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.
IOError: This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.
ZeroDivisionError: This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
ImportError: This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.
These are just a few examples of the many types of exceptions that can occur in Python. Itâ€™s important to handle exceptions properly in your code using try-except blocks or other error-handling techniques, in order to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.

Difference between Syntax Error and Exceptions
Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program. 

Example: 


# initialize the amount variable 
amount = 10000
  
# check that You are eligible to 
#  purchase Dsa Self Paced or not 
if(amount > 2999) 
print("You are eligible to purchase Dsa Self Paced") 
Output:
